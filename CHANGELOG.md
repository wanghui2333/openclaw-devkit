# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [v1.5.6] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **Gateway Access Control**: Relaxed `allowedOrigins` in `docker-entrypoint.sh` to include `http://localhost:18789` and `http://0.0.0.0:18789`, resolving "Origin not allowed" errors when accessing the Control UI via common local addresses.

## [v1.5.5] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **Gateway Network Configuration**: Updated `docker-entrypoint.sh` to use `lan` bind mode by default instead of `all`, respecting existing configurations while ensuring host accessibility.

## [v1.5.4] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **Makefile (Environment Priority)**: Fixed `make install` to correctly respect the `OPENCLAW_IMAGE` environment variable defined in `.env` or the shell, while maintaining the ability to explicitly switch variants (e.g., `make install go`).

## [v1.5.3] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **Docker Build (Go Stack)**: Replaced `rm -rf` with `go clean -modcache` to resolve permission denied errors during image construction as non-root user.

## [v1.5.2] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **Tool Permissions (Non-root Access)**: 
    - Moved the `node` user creation to the base image to ensure availability across all build stages.
    - Relocated **Bun** installation to `/usr/local` (global) to ensure it is executable by the `node` user.
    - Updated **Go toolchain** installation to run under the `node` user with a correctly owned `GOPATH` (`/home/node/go`).
    - Standardized global `PATH` and installation directories for AI Agents (Claude Code, OpenCode, Pi-Mono) to guarantee non-root accessibility.

## [v1.5.1] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Image Update Strategy**: Clearly defined the difference between `make install` (fast/local-first) and `make rebuild` (force sync/update) in documentation and FAQ.
- **Image Update FAQ**: Added troubleshooting entries for forcing image updates to the latest remote version.

### Fixed
- **Windows Bulletproof Compatibility**: 
    - Forced UTF-8 encoding across `Makefile` and interactive `onboard` sessions to prevent mojibake/encoding issues.
    - Automated LF line-ending normalization for shell scripts via `.gitattributes` and self-healing scripts.
    - Improved shell environment detection (recommending Git Bash) and enhanced tilde expansion robustness.
    - Resolved `EACCES /Users` permission errors on Windows by switching from host-paths to container-relative paths in `.env` where necessary.
- **Container Resilience**:
    - Forced `0.0.0.0` binding for the gateway to ensure accessible networking across all environments.
    - Fixed `HOME` directory handling for the `node` user in specialized image variants.
    - Improved `onboard` target to be more resilient to non-fatal errors by restoring missing command prefixes.
- **Documentation Integrity**:
    - Audited and removed several "hallucinated" or obsolete commands (e.g., `make update`) from documentation.
    - Synchronized documentation parity between Chinese and English versions.

## [v1.5.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Pre-Start Config Migration**: Added `openclaw-init` container that runs `openclaw doctor --fix` before gateway starts, preventing "unhealthy container" errors when upgrading from old OpenClaw versions with incompatible config schema.
- **Auto-Cleanup Init Container**: The init container now automatically removes itself after successful config repair, keeping the environment clean.

### Improved
- **Config Migration UX**: Eliminated confusing "Warning: Could not fix permissions" message from entrypoint logs.
- **Startup Reliability**: Gateway now waits for config repair to complete before starting healthcheck, ensuring smooth upgrades.
- **clean-volumes**: Fixed to remove only existing volume references.

- **Docker Workflow Guide**: Added comprehensive `docs/DOCKER_WORKFLOW.md` with artifact matrices, build arguments documentation, and troubleshooting tips.

### Improved
- **Container Setup Routine**: Enhanced `docker-setup.sh` with better permission handling and support for the new hierarchical image structure.
- **Documentation Parity**: Synchronized image variant details and artifact paths across all manuals.

## [v1.4.1] - 2026-03-12

### Changed

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **1+3 Hierarchical Architecture**: Refactored Docker build system into a base image (`Dockerfile.base`) and three specialized variant stacks (Node, Java, Office) to reduce redundancy and improve build speed.
- **Go Variant**: Introduced a dedicated Go language variant (`Dockerfile.go`) integrated into the hierarchical build system.
- **Variant Selection Guide**: Added `docs/IMAGE_VARIANTS.md` for detailed feature comparison between image variants.

- **Slack Setup Guide**: Fixed hallucinations and outdated manifest configurations in both English and Chinese beginner guides. Removed standalone `slack-manifest.json` as it's now integrated directly into the guides.
- **Deployment Strategy**: Removed deprecated `DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md` document.

## [v1.2.2] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
