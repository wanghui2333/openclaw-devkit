# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **1+3 Hierarchical Architecture**: Refactored Docker build system into a base image (`Dockerfile.base`) and three specialized variant stacks (Node, Java, Office) to reduce redundancy and improve build speed.
- **Go Variant**: Introduced a dedicated Go language variant (`Dockerfile.go`) integrated into the hierarchical build system.
- **Variant Selection Guide**: Added `docs/IMAGE_VARIANTS.md` for detailed feature comparison between image variants.

### Changed
- **README Refresh**: Updated core features and installation guide to reflect the new hierarchical architecture and Go support.
- **Build System**: Unified variant builds using `make build-<variant>` pattern with automatic base image dependency tracking.

## [v1.2.4] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Slack Advanced Setup**: Supplemented the Slack Integration manual and `.env.example` templates with advanced configuration options, including Admin Binding, Mention Mode (`groupPolicy`), and Channel Allowed Lists.

## [v1.2.3] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Slack Setup Guide**: Fixed hallucinations and outdated manifest configurations in both English and Chinese beginner guides. Removed standalone `slack-manifest.json` as it's now integrated directly into the guides.
- **Deployment Strategy**: Removed deprecated `DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md` document.

## [v1.2.2] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Docker Permission Fix (macOS)**: Combined `user: "0:0"` (root) with entrypoint `chown` to resolve host-mounted volume permission issues (PR #4).
- **Onboarding Logic**: Updated automatic initialization to use the new `onboard --accept-risk` command flag.

### Improved
- **Smart CI Pipeline**: Enhanced GitHub Actions with path filtering and image-existence checks to skip unnecessary builds.
- **CI Reliability**: Standardized lowercased image names and added concurrency management to prevent redundant workflow runs.
- **Workflow Auditing**: Applied GitHub Actions best practices including Token protection and least-privilege permissions.

## [v1.2.1] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Official Onboarding Wizard**: Added `make onboard` command for interactive configuration of LLM, Feishu, and channels.
- **Zero-Config Bootstrap**: The container automatically initializes if configuration is missing on first run.
- **Domestic Mirror Support**: Support for APT (USTC), NPM (Alibaba), and Python (Tsinghua) mirrors via `.env`.
- **Docker Hub Mirroring**: Introduced `DOCKER_MIRROR` variable to handle Docker Hub pull issues in China.
- **Build Quality**: Added Apt retries and fixed Dockerfile multi-stage `ARG` inheritance.

### Fixed
- **Permission Management**: Fixed outdated documentation regarding root permissions; container now runs safely as `node` user (UID 1000).
- **Documentation Parity**: Synchronized technical details and comparison tables between Chinese and English manuals (`README`, `REFERENCE`).

### Changed
- **Feature Highlights**: Updated README with more concise "Out-of-the-Box" and "Secure Isolation" features.

## [v1.1.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Volume Strategy Documentation**: Comprehensive guide on Named Volumes vs. Bind Mounts, including real-time visibility, permission handling, and performance best practices. Added to `README.md` and `REFERENCE.md`.
- **Environment Configuration**: Added `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_DIR` to `.env.example` for configurable CLI seed paths.

### Changed
- **CLI Service Simplification**: Refactored `openclaw-cli-viking` in `docker-compose.yml` to minimize redundant mounts and utilize unified state volumes.

## [v1.0.7] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- **CI/CD Reliability**: Corrected syntax errors in GitHub Actions workflow (`docker-publish.yml`) that prevented CI triggers.
- **Git Hygiene**: Added `openclaw*.json*` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental tracking of local configuration backups.

## [v1.0.6] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: Added automated multi-architecture Docker build and publish workflow (`amd64`, `arm64`).
- **Multi-Arch Support**: Official support for both Intel/AMD and Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) deployments.

### Fixed
- **Infrastructure Consistency**: Fixed Dockerfile naming mismatches between `docker-compose.yml`, `update-source.sh`, and filesystem.
- **Build Robustness**: Enhanced GitHub Actions to explicitly prepare build context by synchronizing DevKit Dockerfiles with source.

### Changed
- **README Update**: Added documentation for multi-architecture distribution and GHCR usage.

## [v1.0.5] - 2026-03-09
- Initial release with integrated toolchain (Node 22, Go 1.26, Python 3.13).
- Added OCR and PDF processing capabilities for Office variant.
