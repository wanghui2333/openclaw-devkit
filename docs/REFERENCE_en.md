## 🟢 Beginner Tier: Seamless Start

### 1. Fast Mode (Fully Automated Deployment) ⭐
Fast Mode is the core capability of DevKit, leveraging pre-built images from GitHub Packages (GHCR) to skip the cumbersome compilation process.

**Installation Logic**:
When executing `make install`, the system automatically performs several atomic operations:
1. **Environment Audit**: Verifies that Docker and the Compose plugin are installed and healthy.
2. **Seed Population**: If the host lacks a [`.env`](.env) file, it idempotently initializes one from [`.env.example`](.env.example) and generates a 32-digit high-entropy Gateway Token.
3. **Hardware Detection**: Identifies your architecture (x86/ARM) and pulls the corresponding pre-built layers (approx. 2GB).

```bash
# 1. Clone Source (Orchestration Layer only)
git clone https://github.com/hrygo/openclaw-devkit.git && cd openclaw-devkit

# 2. Intelligent Installation
make install
```

### 2. Interactive Onboarding (Config Guide)
After deployment, OpenClaw remains in "Standby". You must inject credentials for LLM providers (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI) and communication platforms (e.g., Feishu, Slack).

```bash
make onboard
```
**Pre-Onboarding Check**:
- **LLM API Key**: Your primary compute source.
- **App Token**: Required if integrating with enterprise chat bots.
- **Workspace ID**: Required if the AI needs to be aware of specific collaborative spaces.
> [!TIP]
> Once completed, `openclaw.json` is securely stored in `~/.openclaw` and hot-loaded by the container on startup.

### 3. Common Operation Commands
| Command | Goal | Technical Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `make up` | Start Services | Runs `openclaw-gateway` and `openclaw-cli` in the background. |
| `make down` | Graceful Stop | Removes containers but preserves Data Volumes and Network definitions. |
| `make logs` | Real-time Audit | Traces task distribution, WebSocket states, and error stacks. |
| `make status` | Health Probe | Displays container health, uptime, and port occupancy. |
| `make restart` | Environment Flush | Combined `down` + `up` to force config refreshes. |

## 🔵 Power User Tier: Productivity Scaling

### 4. Flavor Switching (Technical Matrix)
DevKit offers four curated toolchains to handle different development scenarios:

| Flavor Name | Image Size (Compressed) | Software Stack (Baseline) | Core use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard** | **~2.21 GB** | Node 22, Go 1.26, Python 3.12, Bun | Full-stack dev, AI plugin writing, automation scripts. |
| **Go** | **~2.30 GB** | Standard + Go 1.26, golangci-lint, Go tools | Go backend dev, debugging with dlv, static analysis. |
| **Java** | **~2.20 GB** | Standard + JDK 21, Gradle 8.x, Maven | Enterprise Java dev, large project building & debugging. |
| **Office** | **~4.04 GB** | Standard + LibreOffice, Tesseract OCR, PDF tools | Doc conversion, web scraping, OCR, office automation. |

**Initial Installation** (run once):
```bash
# First-time install with specific flavor
make install go        # Go edition
make install java     # Java edition
make install office   # Office edition
```

**Switching Images Later** (no need to re-run install):
```bash
# Modify OPENCLAW_IMAGE in .env, then:
make rebuild go       # pull/build and restart
make rebuild java     # pull/build and restart
make rebuild office   # pull/build and restart
```

| Operation | Command | When to Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **First Install** | `make install <variant>` | Initial deployment, creates data dirs & config |
| **Switch Image** | `make rebuild <variant>` | Already installed, need to switch versions |

> **Tip**: `make install` is for **first-time setup only**. To switch flavors later, just modify `.env` and use `make build/rebuild`. Data directories are preserved.
>
> Available variants: `go`, `java`, `office` (default: standard)

### 5. Deep Dive: Data Mounting & Persistence
To ensure AI containers are "non-volatile," we designed a dual-track persistence model:

1. **Configuration Backbone (Bind Mount)**:
   - Path: `~/.openclaw/`
   - Purpose: Stores `openclaw.json`. This is the Agent's "Identity Card," allowing direct JSON editing from the host.
2. **Workspace (Bi-directional Sync)**:
   - Path: `~/.openclaw/workspace/`
   - Purpose: Your development workbench. All file changes are synced between host and container in milliseconds.
3. **State Isolation (Named Volume)**:
   - `.openclaw-state`: Stores DB snapshots and session persistence, preventing memory loss during image updates.

### 6. Roles & Dev flow Optimization
For team collaboration or Git management, we recommend the **"Symlink Isolation Method"**:
1. Set the `roles` directory as a symbolic link to your project: `ln -s ./my-private-roles ./roles`.
2. Add the actual path or the link to [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) to keep architectures public and credentials hidden.

### 7. Advanced Usage: Custom Images & Composability
When the pre-built toolchains cannot meet specific business requirements, DevKit provides exceptionally flexible extension capabilities. The best practice is **absolutely not** to modify the official `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` directly, but to seamlessly leverage its designed extensibility.

**Best Practice A: Securely Tailoring Business Images (Custom Image)**
If you need to install specific system packages (like `ffmpeg`) or inject corporate internal certificates:
1. **Inheritance Model**: Create a brand new `Dockerfile.custom` and utilize the official image as the Base Image.
   ```dockerfile
   FROM ghcr.io/hrygo/openclaw-devkit:dev
   USER root
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ffmpeg
   USER node
   ```
2. **Seamless Integration**: Once your bespoke image is built, simply declare `OPENCLAW_IMAGE=my-custom-openclaw:dev` in your `.env`. You can securely switch environments without dismantling any official startup scripts, guaranteeing you effortlessly receive future framework updates.

**Best Practice B: Non-Intrusive Orchestration Enhancement (Compose Override)**
When you need to hook specialized business persistence directories to the gateway container, or inject a sidecar service locally (such as an ephemeral Redis Server):
1. **Establish an Override File**: Scaffold a `docker-compose.override.yml` inside the root directory. The Docker Compose engine natively honors this file to merge, augment, and override the primary configuration (`docker-compose.yml`) securely. This completely evades Git conflict hazards.
2. **Inject Volumes Elegantly**: Decouple logic cleanly by defining your custom Volumes and extra parameters natively inside the override file, enabling true segregation of configuration overrides from your core tracked codebase.

## ⚡ Extension: Third-party Communication Platforms
OpenClaw supports connecting to various office platforms via Socket Mode.

> 💡 **Why specifically Slack and Feishu (Lark)?**
> For code-assist scenarios, **convenience** and **expressiveness** are paramount. Unlike standard chat apps, Slack and Feishu offer **advanced rich text capabilities** (flawless Markdown rendering, highlighted code blocks, key interaction) that makes reading code and confirming diffs feel as natural as within an IDE. Furthermore, their native support for **persistent connections (Socket Mode / WebSocket)** drastically lowers the barrier to entry—even without a public IP or when deep inside an intranet firewall, it completely eliminates the headache of configuring complex Webhook tunnels, offering a truly "plug-and-play" seamless connection setup.

- **Slack (Recommended)**: Refer to the [Slack Setup Beginner Guide](SLACK_SETUP_BEGINNER_en.md).
- **Feishu (Lark)**: Refer to the [Feishu (Lark) Guide](FEISHU_SETUP_BEGINNER_en.md).

## 🔴 Architect Tier: Deep Architectural Insights

### 8. Core Logic: Layered Orchestration
The DevKit `Makefile` is a precision engine that dynamically reassembles Compose files based on environment variables:
- **Static Layer** (`docker-compose.yml`): Defines the topology.
- **Enhancement Layer** (`docker-compose.build.yml`): Activated when `OPENCLAW_SKIP_BUILD=false`, injecting Dockerfile paths and build-time proxies.
- **Dynamic Overrides**: `docker-setup.sh` generates `docker-compose.dev.extra.yml` at runtime to handle custom user mounts (`OPENCLAW_EXTRA_MOUNTS`).

### 9. Initialization Lifecycle (Deep Trace)
When you start a container, `docker-entrypoint.sh` takes over for the first 5 seconds:
1. **UID Adaptation**: Detects the host User ID and performs `chown` to fix permissions on mounted volumes, eliminating `EACCES` errors.
2. **Seed Injection**: If the workspace is empty, it automatically populates it from the internal `/home/node/.openclaw-seed`.
3. **Network Alignment**: Locks the gateway port and sets the bind address to `lan` to bypass Docker bridge network isolation (`loopback` mode would prevent host access).


### 10. Security Whitepaper: Sandbox & Network Binding
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Least Privilege Principle**:
> - Containers have `NET_RAW` and `NET_ADMIN` capabilities dropped to prevent AI agents from probing host LANs.
> - `no-new-privileges` flag is enabled to cut off privilege escalation paths.
> - **Network Binding**: All Web UIs listen on `127.0.0.1` internally and are exposed via Docker port mapping to minimize the public attack surface.

## ❓ Troubleshooting (QA / FAQ)

<details>
<summary><b>Q: curl inside container timed out or SSL handshake failed?</b></summary>
1. Check if <code>HTTPS_PROXY</code> in <code>.env</code> points to <code>http://host.docker.internal:[PORT]</code>.
2. Ensure your host proxy software has <b>"Allow LAN"</b> enabled.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q: Why is my agent.json config file missing?</b></summary>
A: Please verify the actual mount path of <code>OPENCLAW_CONFIG_DIR</code>. It defaults to <code>~/.openclaw</code>. You can verify by searching for the file directly on the host.
</details>
