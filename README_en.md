## 🚥 Quick Start (From Scratch)

If you are cloning this project for the first time, follow these steps to ensure a complete environment setup:

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure the host machine has:
- **Docker & Docker Compose (V2)**
- **Make** (standard on most Unix-like systems)
- **Network Proxy** (Optional, for accessing Claude/Google APIs in restricted environments)
    > [!TIP]
    > 💡 **Tip**: We recommend adding `127.0.0.1 host.docker.internal` to your host machine's `hosts` file. This allows both local and containerized development to share the same proxy configuration string (`http://host.docker.internal:port`), improving environment consistency.


### 2. Initialize Environment
```bash
# 0. Enter the directory
cd openclaw-devkit

# 1. Prepare environment variable file
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Pull OpenClaw core source (Must do for the first time, or image build will fail)
# The script automatically pulls the latest code from GitHub Releases and extracts it to .openclaw_src/
make update

# 3. Initialize Docker development image
# Default Standard Edition
make install

# For Office Automation (Pro Edition)
make install office

# For Java Enhanced Edition
make install java
```

### 3. Start & Verify
```bash
# 1. Start services
make up

# 2. Verify connectivity (Optional)
# Check connectivity to Google/Claude APIs from within the container
make test-proxy
```

### 4. Access Interface
- **Web Console**: [http://127.0.0.1:18789](http://127.0.0.1:18789)
- **Debug Logs**: `make logs`

---

### Interactive Setup (onboard)

First-time setup requires running the interactive wizard to configure LLM providers, Feishu, channels, and other core settings:

```bash
# Launch interactive setup wizard
make onboard
```

This wizard will guide you through:
- 🤖 **LLM Configuration**: Select and configure Claude/OpenAI/Qwen models
- 📱 **Feishu Integration**: Configure Feishu bot permissions and channels
- 📢 **Notification Channels**: Set up message delivery methods and recipients

> [!TIP]
> If you're using a prebuilt image, configuration data persists in the `openclaw-state` volume—no need to reconfigure after container restarts.

---

> [!WARNING]
> ## ⚠️ Important Security Warning: Do NOT Mix Container & Host Installation
>
> This project shares configuration with the host machine via the `~/.openclaw` directory. Using both running methods simultaneously poses **security risks**:
>
> | Running Mode | `gateway.bind` Required | Security Notes |
> | :----------- | :--------------------- | :------------- |
> | **Docker Container** | `lan` (bind to `0.0.0.0`) | ✅ **Required** — Docker port mapping `127.0.0.1:18789` restricts access to localhost only |
> | **Host Direct Run** | `loopback` (bind to `127.0.0.1`) | ⚠️ Using `lan` will expose to local network |
>
> ### Why must containers use `lan`?
> Docker port mapping `127.0.0.1:18789:18789` means requests received by the host are forwarded to the container. If the service inside the container binds to `127.0.0.1`, it cannot properly receive requests forwarded from the Docker network layer. Binding to `0.0.0.0` is required for it to work.
>
> ### Recommended Approach
> 1. **Container-only usage** (recommended): Keep `gateway.bind = "lan"`, do not install OpenClaw on the host
> 2. **Need to run on host directly**: Change to `gateway.bind = "loopback"`, and ensure containers are stopped before starting host services
> 3. **Need both**: Use **separate config directories** (e.g., `~/.openclaw-docker` and `~/.openclaw-local`)
>
> ```bash
> # Check current bind config
> cat ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json | jq '.gateway.bind'
>
> # Change to loopback (for host direct run)
> # In config file, change "bind": "lan" to "bind": "loopback"
> ```

### Project Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](docs/assets/architecture.svg)

---

## 🔁 Core Workflow & File Collaboration

To achieve an "out-of-the-box" experience, this project establishes a self-consistent file collaboration system:

1. **Entry Layer (`Makefile`)**: Serves as the primary interface for user operations, encapsulating complex Docker commands and hiding environment interaction complexity.
2. **Initialization Layer (`docker-setup.sh`)**: Triggered by `make install`. It reads `.env` configurations, pre-creates host directory trees, handles permission fixes, and calls `Dockerfile` to build the customized development image.
3. **Orchestration Layer (`docker-compose.yml`)**: The central dispatch center. It defines network abstractions between containers, environment variable injection, and efficient `node_modules` caching using Named Volumes.
4. **Runtime Layer (`Dockerfile*`)**: The physical definition of the environment. It integrates Node.js, Go, Python, and browser engines into a single container, eliminating the "it works on my machine" paradox.
5. **Maintenance Layer (`update-source.sh`)**: Automated update mechanism. It monitors version changes via GitHub API, enabling one-click source hot updates and cleanup of old images.

---

## 🤖 Slack Integration Guide

To enable Slack interaction, follow these steps to configure your Slack App:

### 1. Quick Setup (Recommended: Using Manifest)
1. Visit the [Slack API Console](https://api.slack.com/apps) and click **"Create New App"**.
2. Choose **"From an app manifest"** and select your target workspace.
3. Copy the contents of [`slack-manifest.json`](./slack-manifest.json) from the project root and paste it.
4. Generate an **App-level Token** (`xapp-...`) under **"Settings" -> "Socket Mode"** with the `connections:write` scope.
5. Install the app into your workspace to obtain the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-...`).

### 2. Environment Configuration & Pairing
1. Add your tokens to the `.env` file. **OpenClaw will automatically enable the Slack channel upon startup when these variables are detected.**
2. **Execute Pairing**: Run `make pairing CMD="list slack"` to see pending pairing requests (verification codes).
3. **Complete Pairing**: Send the code to the bot in Slack, or run `make pairing CMD="approve slack CODE"`.

```bash
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token
# ...
```

### 3. Best Practices & Default Behavior
- **Auto-Enable**: As long as valid tokens exist in `.env`, the channel is enabled automatically without needing `enabled: true` in `openclaw.json`.
- **Privacy First (Default Allowlist)**: For security, channel messages default to `allowlist` mode (only responding in allowed channels). DMs default to `pairing` mode (requires running `make pairing` to approve).
- **Use Socket Mode**: This is the default for DevKit, allowing you to receive Slack events locally without network tunneling (no static IP or ngrok required).
- **Security Isolation**: In production, use `SLACK_PRIMARY_OWNER` to restrict access to sensitive administrative commands.

## 🔌 Advanced Volume Mounts

> ⚠️ **Note**: Some paths in the "Host Path" column (e.g., `~/.gitconfig-hotplex`) are **examples only**. You need to adjust the corresponding paths in `docker-compose.yml` **based on your own setup**.

By default, OpenClaw automatically mounts the following directories to make host resources accessible within the container.

### Required Mounts (Essential for Basic Functionality)

> ⚠️ These mounts use variables defined in `.env` (`OPENCLAW_CONFIG_DIR`, `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR`) - no manual modification needed

| Host Path (.env variable)       | Container Path                   | Purpose                                                    |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| `${OPENCLAW_CONFIG_DIR}`        | `/home/node/.openclaw-seed:ro`   | Configuration seed (read-only, required for first startup) |
| `${OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR}`     | `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace` | Workspace files (AI working directory - required!)         |
| `openclaw-state` (Named Volume) | `/home/node/.openclaw`           | Persistent state (sessions, credentials, logs)             |

### Optional Mounts (Choose Based on Your Needs)

| Host Path                            | Container Path                    | Purpose                                                                             |
| :----------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `~/.claude`                          | `/home/node/.claude`              | Claude Code session state (mount to share sessions)                                 |
| `~/.gitconfig-xxx` (adjust)          | `/home/node/.gitconfig:ro`        | **Dedicated Git identity** (gives AI its own identity, separate from your main one) |
| `openclaw-node-modules` (Volume)     | `/app/node_modules`               | Node.js dependency cache (speeds up restarts)                                       |
| `openclaw-go-mod` (Volume)           | `/home/node/go/pkg/mod`           | Go module cache (mount when using Go)                                               |
| `openclaw-playwright-cache` (Volume) | `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright` | Playwright browser cache (mount when using browser automation)                      |
 
### 💾 Storage Persistence: Named Volumes vs Bind Mounts

This project uses a hybrid mounting strategy to balance performance and usability:

1. **Named Volumes**: e.g., `openclaw-state`.
   - **Pros**: Fully managed by Docker, high performance on macOS/Windows, persistent across container removals.
   - **Cons**: "Inaccessible" directly from the host filesystem (stored within Docker's internal subsystem).
2. **Bind Mounts**: e.g., `${OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR}`.
   - **Pros**: Maps directly to a host directory, allowing you to edit files using your favorite host tools (VS Code, etc.).
   - **Cons**: Slower performance on non-Linux systems due to filesystem sync overhead; subject to host permission issues.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Counter-intuitive Issue**: Named Volumes have an "initialization" feature. If the container image's internal path already contains files, they are copied to the volume *only during the first mount*. Subsequent image updates will **not** be reflected in the volume unless it is manually cleared. For more details, see the [Reference Manual (REFERENCE_en.md)](./docs/REFERENCE_en.md#💾-storage--persistence).

### Why Use `~/.gitconfig-xxx` Instead of `~/.gitconfig`?

**Core Reason**: Give OpenClaw a **separate Git identity**, distinct from your main development environment.

| Comparison   | Your Main Environment | OpenClaw Environment   |
| :----------- | :-------------------- | :--------------------- |
| Config File  | `~/.gitconfig`        | `~/.gitconfig-hotplex` |
| Git Username | `YourName`            | `HotPlexBot01`         |
| Git Email    | `you@example.com`     | `noreply@hotplex.dev`  |
| Purpose      | Daily development     | AI automation          |

**Benefits**:
1. **Clear distinction**: GitHub/GitLab commit history shows at a glance whether commits were made by "human" or "AI"
2. **Permission isolation**: You can configure different SSH keys or PATs for OpenClaw's Git account
3. **Avoid conflicts**: Prevent AI from accidentally modifying your human commit history

> 💡 **Tip**: Replace `xxx` with your identifier, e.g., `~/.gitconfig-openclaw`, `~/.gitconfig-bot`, etc.

### Adding Custom Mounts

To let OpenClaw access more host directories, modify `docker-compose.yml` directly:

#### Modify docker-compose.yml (Recommended)

Add new mount entries to the `openclaw-gateway` service's `volumes` section:

```yaml
services:
  openclaw-gateway:
    volumes:
      # ... existing mounts ...

      # Add custom mount
      - /your/project/path:/home/node/your/container/path:rw
```

### Common Extension Scenarios

| Scenario                      | Mount Example                                     |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| Access host code repositories | `- ~/projects:/home/node/projects:rw`             |
| Access download files         | `- ~/Downloads:/home/node/Downloads:rw`           |
| Access sensitive configs      | `- ~/.aws:/home/node/.aws:ro` (read-only)         |
| Share team configurations     | `- /shared/team-config:/home/node/team-config:rw` |

### ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Permission Issues**: The container runs as root by default (`user: "0:0"`), files created may appear as root ownership on host
2. **Path Format**: Windows paths need Docker-style format (e.g., `//c/Users/...`) or WSL paths
3. **Read-only Mounts**: Use `:ro` suffix for directories that don't need write access - more secure
4. **Restart Required**: Volume changes require `make down && make up` to take effect

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Cannot access the internet or Claude API from within the container?**
A: Ensure your host proxy service (e.g., Clash/V2Ray) has "Allow LAN Connections" enabled, and the port matches those in `.env`. Use `make test-proxy` to verify.

**Q: Got error "Cannot find module '@mariozechner/pi-ai/oauth" when starting?**
A: This is because the dependency version in the pre-built image doesn't match the source code. Run the following to clean and retry:

```bash
make down && docker volume rm openclaw-node-modules && make up
```

**Cause**: The named volume persists `node_modules`. When source code is updated, dependency versions may change, but the volume retains the old version, causing module not found errors.

**Q: How to update to the latest official OpenClaw release?**
A: Simply run `make update`. The script handles extraction and directory replacement automatically.

**Q: Changed image configuration but it's not taking effect?**
A: Use `make build` instead of `make up`, or run `make rebuild` directly.
