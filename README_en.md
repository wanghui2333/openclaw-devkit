**OpenClaw DevKit** provides a complete containerized development, debugging, and runtime environment for the [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) multi-channel AI productivity tool.

It integrates an out-of-the-box toolchain designed to help developers quickly build AI workflows based on OpenClaw, supporting automatic source updates, one-click environment setup, and built-in network optimization for various environments.

## 🚥 Quick Start (From Scratch)

If you are cloning this project for the first time, follow these steps to ensure a complete environment setup:

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure the host machine has:
- **Docker & Docker Compose (V2)**
- **Make** (standard on most Unix-like systems)
- **Network Proxy** (Optional, for accessing Claude/Google APIs in restricted environments)
    > [!TIP]
    > 💡 **Tip**: We recommend adding `127.0.0.1 host.docker.internal` to your host machine's `hosts` file. This allows both local and containerized development to share the same proxy configuration string (`http://host.docker.internal:port`), improving environment consistency.

### 2. Initialize Environment
```bash
# 1. Prepare environment variable file
cp .env.example

# 2. Pull OpenClaw core source (Must do for the first time, or image build will fail)
# The script automatically pulls the latest code from GitHub Releases and extracts it to .openclaw_src/
make update

# 3. Initialize Docker development image
# Default Standard Edition
make install

# For Office Automation (Pro Edition)
make install office

# For Java Enhanced Edition
make install java
```

### 3. Start & Verify
```bash
# 1. Start services
make up

# 2. Verify connectivity (Optional)
# Check connectivity to Google/Claude APIs from within the container
make test-proxy
```

### 4. Access Interface
- **Web Console**: [http://127.0.0.1:18789](http://127.0.0.1:18789)
- **Debug Logs**: `make logs`

---


 Or switch manually via environment variables:
1. Modify `.env` file: `OPENCLAW_IMAGE=openclaw:pro` (or `openclaw:dev-java`)
2. Run `make up`

## 🔁 Core Workflow & File Collaboration

To achieve an "out-of-the-box" experience, this project establishes a self-consistent file collaboration system:

1. **Entry Layer (`Makefile`)**: Serves as the primary interface for user operations, encapsulating complex Docker commands and hiding environment interaction complexity.
2. **Initialization Layer (`docker-setup.sh`)**: Triggered by `make install`. It reads `.env` configurations, pre-creates host directory trees, handles permission fixes, and calls `Dockerfile` to build the customized development image.
3. **Orchestration Layer (`docker-compose.yml`)**: The central dispatch center. It defines network abstractions between containers, environment variable injection, and efficient `node_modules` caching using Named Volumes.
4. **Runtime Layer (`Dockerfile*`)**: The physical definition of the environment. It integrates Node.js, Go, Python, and browser engines into a single container, eliminating the "it works on my machine" paradox.
5. **Maintenance Layer (`update-source.sh`)**: Automated update mechanism. It monitors version changes via GitHub API, enabling one-click source hot updates and cleanup of old images.

## 🤖 Slack Integration Guide

To enable Slack interaction, follow these steps to configure your Slack App:

### 1. Quick Setup (Recommended: Using Manifest)
1. Visit the [Slack API Console](https://api.slack.com/apps) and click **"Create New App"**.
2. Choose **"From an app manifest"** and select your target workspace.
3. Copy the contents of [`slack-manifest.json`](./slack-manifest.json) from the project root and paste it.
4. Generate an **App-level Token** (`xapp-...`) under **"Settings" -> "Socket Mode"** with the `connections:write` scope.
5. Install the app into your workspace to obtain the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-...`).

### 2. Environment Configuration & Pairing
1. Add your tokens to the `.env` file. **OpenClaw will automatically enable the Slack channel upon startup when these variables are detected.**
2. **Execute Pairing**: Run `make pairing CMD="list slack"` to see pending pairing requests (verification codes).
3. **Complete Pairing**: Send the code to the bot in Slack, or run `make pairing CMD="approve slack CODE"`.

```bash
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token
# ...
```

### 3. Best Practices & Default Behavior
- **Auto-Enable**: As long as valid tokens exist in `.env`, the channel is enabled automatically without needing `enabled: true` in `openclaw.json`.
- **Privacy First (Default Allowlist)**: For security, channel messages default to `allowlist` mode (only responding in allowed channels). DMs default to `pairing` mode (requires running `make pairing` to approve).
- **Use Socket Mode**: This is the default for DevKit, allowing you to receive Slack events locally without network tunneling (no static IP or ngrok required).
- **Security Isolation**: In production, use `SLACK_PRIMARY_OWNER` to restrict access to sensitive administrative commands.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Cannot access the internet or Claude API from within the container?**
A: Ensure your host proxy service (e.g., Clash/V2Ray) has "Allow LAN Connections" enabled, and the port matches those in `.env`. Use `make test-proxy` to verify.

**Q: How to update to the latest official OpenClaw release?**
A: Simply run `make update`. The script handles extraction and directory replacement automatically.

**Q: Changed image configuration but it's not taking effect?**
A: Use `make build` instead of `make up`, or run `make rebuild` directly.
